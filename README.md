# <Precourse Study Guide>

## Description

This study guide for bootcamp students records notes on the four main areas of content covered by the precourse work. Information overload is a problem for bootcamp students, given the fast pace of the bootcamp learning environment. It is a problem for this bootcamp student in particular, given the dearth of any prior knowledge of coding. The study guide organizes the new learning delivered in the precourse work so that it is summarized, categorized by topic and easy to review in point form. When students open the console in ChromeDevTools they also receive a dynamic suggestion about what to study first. The new learning in HTML, CSS and JavaScript (three of the four topics covered by the study guide) was put into practice in the creation of the guide itself. Git and Github (the fourth topic covered by the study guide) were also employed as an infrastructure for developing the guide, along with VSCode and ChromeDevTools. 

The project effectively illustrated how HTML, CSS and JavaScript work together to create a web application, showcasing the various capabilities of each. Interesting was the way the .html index file integrated references to the .css style sheet in its head and to the .js file in its body. The basic organization of the guide into headings and unnumbered lists, together with the link of the bowtie cat image, were developed in HTML. The colouration and shadowing of the boxes, together with their placement using margins and padding, and the resizing of the bowtie cat image were developed in CSS. Finally, using JS, a for loop was created to log each element in an array in ChromeDevTool's console where the variable was the topics, and the for loop was wrapped in a function and the function called. And the dynamic suggestion of which topic to study was created using a conditional wrapped in a randomizing function and the function called. Strings were added to explain the randomized feature of the console's output. All this was new learning. 

In terms of the use that was made of git and github, which was also new learning, not of content but of a developer's regular workflow process, the study guide was developed locally using VSCode and debugged using ChromeDevTools, but the most updated version of the project was pulled from the main branch hosted remotely at github using git commands in the control line. The changes made on the feature branch were then pushed up to the main branch at github.com using pull requests with appropriate messaging and the merge procedure. Isssues, created in markdown, were successively closed as the project took each new step toward completion.

## Installation

As a deployed web application the precourse study guide is available with no need for local installation at its url on the worldwide web. To access the full functionality of the guide, the user needs to use ChromeDevTools, a built-in feature of the Chrome browser. Open ChromeDevTool's console by rightclicking anywhere on the screen in the browswer and selecting "inspect" from the dropdown menu, or with keyboard commands (command+option+I for MacOS, control+shift+I for Windows).

## Usage

Usage of the main web application page is straightforward in that the notes for each topic, presented as an unnumbered list, are immediately available to view.  To obtain the randomized suggestion of what to study first the user will need to open the console, which will appear to the side of the webpage when command+option+I (OS) or control+shift+I (Windows) is entered.
